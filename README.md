# dir2msa
Atari-ST floppy disk image creator

Just drag&drop a directory or a zip file on dir2msa.exe and you'll get a fresh new .msa Atari floppy disk file image.

# note
dir2msa is an old tool I wrote long time ago, distributed with SainT Atari emulator. I just put the old source code on github so anyone could fix or improve.
